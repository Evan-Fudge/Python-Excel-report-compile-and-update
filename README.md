Here is a script I wrote that takes incomplete data from the daily_sheet, then compiles the data from the daily_sheet with existing data from a master_data_sheet to output a New_Master_Report with up to date records. 
The code also then takes the missing data from the master sheet and writes it into the daily report and outputs a New_Daily_Report so that it may look more formal.
The script also formats the header of the new_daily_report and changes the width of the column for a proper fit.
The same column width adjustment is performed on the New_Master_Report.
